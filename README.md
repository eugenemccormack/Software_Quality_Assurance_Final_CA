For this assignment I used Fibonacci Sequence for Story Point Estimation. The Fibonacci sequence is a number sequence where every number is the sum of the previous two numbers, i.e. 0, 1, 2, 3, 5 etc. 

<br />

|Item | Task | Owner | Point Estimation |
| --- | ---  |  ---  |     ---      |
|  1  | Create Controller | Eugene McCormack | 1 |
|  2  | Create Class Models (Rubric, Subject, Student) | Eugene McCormack | 1 |
|  3  | Setup Menu System to Allow Navigation | Eugene McCormack | 1 |
|  4  | Implement Method to Create New Rubric | Eugene McCormack | 2 |
|  5  | Create Test for Method to Create New Rubric | Eugene McCormack | 3 |
|  6  | Implement Method to Create New Student| Eugene McCormack | 2 |
|  7  | Create Test for Method to Create New Student | Eugene McCormack | 3 |
|  8  | Implement Method to Create New Subject and Add to a Grade| Eugene McCormack | 2 |
|  9  | Create Test for Method to Create New Subject | Eugene McCormack | 3 |
|  10  | Create Method to View All Rubric's | Eugene McCormack | 1 |
|  11  | Create Method to View a  Specified Rubric Via Name | Eugene McCormack | 1 |
|  12  | Implement Method to Retrieve All Student's Grades and Display Average Grade| Eugene McCormack | 3 |
|  13  | Implement Method to Retrieve All Student's Grades and Display Standard Deviation of Grades| Eugene McCormack | 3 |
|  14  | Implement Method to Retrieve All Student's Grades and Display Max / Min Grade| Eugene McCormack | 1 |
|  15  | Create Test for Students Grades, Average, Standard Deviation and Max / Min | Eugene McCormack | 5 |
|  16  | Implement Method to Retrieve Specified Criterion of a Rubric and Display the Average, Standard Deviation and Max / Min Grade| Eugene McCormack | 2 |

As this assignment is not too complex and I have previously implemented some of the above features in past projects this allowed me to provide these estimations. I estimated "Item 5" above "Create Test for Method to Create New Rubric" with a Point Estimation of "3" as I have only conducted a few tests in previous classes. I expect “Item 5” to take longer than "Item 4 - "Implement Method to Create New Rubric" with a Point Estimation of "2" as I have previously implanted this feature before and am confident this should not take as long . I suspect the main tasks that will take the longest are the tasks that I am somewhat unfamiliar with.

<br />

Also I estimated  “Item 13 - Implement Method to Retrieve All Student's Grades and Display Standard Deviation of Grades” with a Point Estimation of “3” as I am unsure how this will pan out. In contrast “Item 14 - Implement Method to Retrieve All Student's Grades and Display Max / Min Grade” with a Point Estimation of “1” should not take too long as this should be a simple call of Max/Min to the ArrayList items.
